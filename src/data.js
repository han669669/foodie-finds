Despite their young age, their restaurant has been receiving great reviews for its authentic and homely Indonesian cuisine, with dishes like ayam bakar, gado gado, and oxtail soup. Oxtail is deep-fried to perfection, giving it a crispy outer layer while remaining juicy and tender inside. If you love Indonesian food, this is a spot you don't want to miss!",
