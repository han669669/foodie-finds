    review: "michelin-recommended, known for their crispy and flaky puffs with flavorful fillings inside. This stall is a favourite among locals and it's definitely rated as one of Singapore's top-rated curry puffs! Each puff is generously stuffed with filling and I tried all the four different flavours they offered, which includes their signature curry chicken, black pepper chicken, sardine and yam paste puff. All of them were freshly prepared and tasted so good!",

    review: "run by three Indonesian-born, Gen Z sisters. Despite their young age, their restaurant has been receiving great reviews for its authentic and homely Indonesian cuisine, with dishes like ayam bakar, gado gado, and oxtail soup. Oxtail is deep-fried to perfection, giving it a crispy outer layer while remaining juicy and tender inside. If you love Indonesian food, this is a spot you don't want to miss!",
