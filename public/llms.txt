  review: a well-known spot famous for their authentic Hakka-style yong tau foo that always has a long queue! Unlike the usual YTF you find at hawker centers, Hakka yong tau foo is stuffed generously with minced meat instead of fish paste, which gives it a more robust flavour.

  review: opening hours 24/7, making them a go-to supper spot for Singaporeans to satisfy their late night roti prata cravings. This prata tsunami was flooded with 5 different gravy - hence it's name Tsunami. It's got curry and topped with tikka chicken, eggs and sambal.

  review: michelin-recommended, known for their crispy and flaky puffs with flavorful fillings inside. This stall is a favourite among locals and it's definitely rated as one of Singapore's top-rated curry puffs! Each puff is generously stuffed with filling and I tried all the four different flavours they offered, which includes their signature curry chicken, black pepper chicken, sardine and yam paste puff. All of them were freshly prepared and tasted so good!

  review: run by three Indonesian-born, Gen Z sisters. Despite their young age, their restaurant has been receiving great reviews for its authentic and homely Indonesian cuisine, with dishes like ayam bakar, gado gado, and oxtail soup. Oxtail is deep-fried to perfection, giving it a crispy outer layer while remaining juicy and tender inside. If you love Indonesian food, this is a spot you don't want to miss!

  review: michelin-recommended stall in Zion Hawker Centre! Kway teow noodles are fried to order and topped with fish cake and cockles. The wok hei impresses with its robust flavours and a hint of spiciness, while the cockles impart extra umami. The wait can be long, but is well worth it.

  review: hidden away in the bustling streets of Chinatown, we've stumbled upon a true gem - 恭敬李炝锅鱼. While they're known for their sizzling braised fish, we're here for something even more special: their heavenly baozi (steamed pork buns) with over 30 years of history!
